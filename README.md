# Portfolio

This is a web application to show the projects I have made.

## Inspiration

The application is made in JavaScript (React + Three.js). It is my first 3D application and it is inspired by the dice in Dungeons and Dragons, that I am a true fan.

## Contents

Inside you can get to know me through Bio, Skills and samples of my projects. You can use any of the code of the porftolio application in any way you see fit and I need no attribution whatsoever.
